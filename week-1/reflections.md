-- 1.2 The Command Line --
==============================

A "Shell" is the generic term for a user interface (graphical or text-based) used to interact with a computer's operating system.  "Bash", a command line interpreter, is an example of a text-based shell.  Bash is the current standard shell used in most Unix systems

OK, so, I can't be the only one who's intimidated by the prospect of using the command line. Certainly after a little more practice and gained experience, I'll understand the hype.  But, the way I see it, binary is the lowest level of communication available to humans for computer interaction (akin to grunting). And, on the other end of the spectrum are the closer to spoken tongue languages, such as Ruby.  I can appreciate the efficiency in the concise, short-handed nature of the command line. However, the language lacks formality and refinement, rendering it cryptic and about as appealing of a language as primitive mongoloid.

So, alright, maybe I'm being harsh, a touch hasty, and a little bit over dramatic. I'll concede that my negative reflections stem from inexperience and my own ignorance. That's why I'm here after all, to learn the hard stuff the hard way.   :-)   

pwd - print working directory: prints the directory that your currently working in.

ls - list: prints a list of all the files and directories included within the current working directory.

mv - move: tells the interpreter to relocate the given file to the specified directory.

cd - change directory: navigates you directly to the specified directory.

../ - parent:  references the file path before the current working directory.

touch - when no matching file exists and new empty file is created, otherwise the file is opened, saved, and closed.

mkdir - make directory: creates a new directory in place.

less - allows you to view and navigate through large files without changing them.

rmdir - remove directory: deletes a directory and the files within it.

rm - remove: deletes the file specified.

help - provides you a list of the commands currently available to you.

-- 1.4 Forking and Cloning --
===================================

To create a new, blank repository from scratch, you will:

=> First, navigate to your GitHub profile page
=> Next, locate and select the "+"-sign near the upper right-hand corner of the profile.
=> Select "New Repository" from the dropdown menu.
=> Fill in the New Repository Form with the necessary information (title, licence, etc.).
=> When ready, click "Create Repository".
=> Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care!

If/when you wish to build on code that has already been written by someone else, there is no need to start from scratch with a brand new blank repository. Simply navigate to the existing code's repository and click the "Fork" button.  This will create a new separate but equal replica of the existing repository in a new repository on your profile. Any  changes made to your new copy will have now effect on the original version.  And, once you download and link the file to your own local system by way of "cloning" it, your all set to start working and tracking your changes.
