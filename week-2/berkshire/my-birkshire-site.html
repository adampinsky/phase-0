- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
>>  The use of section, header, aside, address,....etc. is cleaner and more direct than the rampant div usage of yesteryear. I would have
>>said that I had a solid understand the functionality of HTML. But, after learning the more semantic tags that came with HTML5, I have
>>had a vail lfted. I now see how my understanding of the purpose of HTML was merky and blurred by layers of divs. The new symantics
>>provide a more defined markup.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
>>I didnt really find it too difficult, now that I have a better understanding of how to use HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
>>Some of the tags are given names and default stylings that might reeenforce inaccurate usage due
to preconcieved notions of what a perticualr elemet should be used for.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
>>I don't know....righty tighty, lefty loosey? Nope, no shortcuts yet.
