What is your site's primary goal or purpose? 
---
To showcase my experience as a programmer and provide contact information.

What kind of content will your site feature?

Headshot, Navigation Bar, Contact Links, Image Links, Gallery, Biographical Text.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
---
Someone looking at my sit would be wanting to gain insight into who I am as a programmer as well as what types of projects motivate me.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
---
The user should be able to easily view a portfolio of my work.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
---
One of the main things that someone should keep in mind when thinking about design and UX is that the UX is directly effected by the design of the product. If a product isn't designed well, the user can miss the intended purpose or worse not use it at all.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

UX centered design is the design principal where the End User's experience (ease of use, novilty, accuricy, speed/reliability, emotiional impact, accesability) is the central force driving the design.
