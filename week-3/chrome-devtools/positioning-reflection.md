What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
---
`Static`|| The default setting. This places each element one after the other, with its own horizontal space.

`Relative`|| Combined with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties to set the position of the element relative to its own default static position.

`Fixed`|| Positions the element reletive to the viewport window.  The element is lockedin place, and made to occupy its own space, removed from the normal flow of layout.

`Absolute`|| Positions the element in a fixed location reletive to the origin of its parent element.




What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
---
`Margin`|| The space outside of and element's content area creeating space between elements.

`Border`|| The space between an element's margin and its padding.  Serves as a visual representation of the element's bounds.

`Padding`|| The space inside of the element's  content area surrounding the content itself. useful when wanting to pull focus to an element by creating more space for it.
