			        <p>Have you ever played one of those "Find the Differences" games? You're given two seemingly identical images placed side by side for you to scrutinize.  And, it is your task to discover and pinpoint the 5 or so minute discrepancies between the two versions of the same photo.  If you weren't the one that made those changes, than it can be very difficult to find those errors.  You might even swear to have discovered a difference where one does not in fact exist.  Using a Version Control System (VCS) such as Git to track the changes you make in project files as you work away is thorough, archival, and collaborative. Consider, again, that photo searching game. The "save\save as" file system would be akin to starting with the original photo, then replacing it with the a new clean, edited version and expected to play with only the new image and your memory to go off of.  With VCS and Git you not only have a version of the photo as it was before the edits still on hand for you to reference, but the new version of the photo has all the edits circled for you.  It doesn't make for the most entertaining game, true; but it sure as hell makes debugging a project a bit smoother.</p>

||What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

>> section, article, header, and main ~~ I use these new semantic tags most frequently because of their semantic meanings.
>>They are common elements to a variaty of different usecases. So it would make sence to have dedicated tags for them to cutback
>>on statard code.
===
||How do elements get laid out on a page?

>> HTML5 ustilizes a new "outlining algorithm" to autonomusly generate an outline of the webpage
>>based on the new semantic tags. 
===
||What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

>>The flow goes <nav> => <article> => <aside> => <section>

||What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

>>Subime has a feture called snippets which are short chunks of code that are used frequently and kept >>>onhand so that they can be quickly referaned and added to our text. Once I figure out how/where a new >>snippet is saved, I would love to spend some time looking into some of the other sippets available.
